# Chapter 4 - Learn More python the hard way

Main idea of this project is to compare program argument handling, comparing `argparse` vs using `sys.argv`

## Study Drills

* What other Python argument parsing libraries are there?

	* [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/)
	* [fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire)
	* [docopt](https://github.com/docopt/docopt)

* What is the main advantage of `argparse` vs `sys.argv`?

  Main advantage of using argparse is that it allows you to create help messages, optional and positional arguments without having to create complicated custom solutions to parse the program arguments which are only stored as a list object in `sys.argv`
