## Study Drills

1. How much of `find` did you implement?

   Only managed to implement the directory, `name` and `type` arguments

2. What are the libraries you have found to improve this implementation?

   I found that the `pathlib` module useful.

   For instance, I can construct a Path object which can take a relative
   path and search for wildcard file extensions within it.

   Normally, that could only be done using combination of 2 or more modules,
   such as with `os` and `glob`
